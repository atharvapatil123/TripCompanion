### Anon Aadhar
The age and gender of the users are verified using anon adhaar verification, without revealing their identity or personal details, which will help in reducing fraud users. As we are storing the hash after successful verification using anon adhaar, the same adhaar card can only be used once to register. For any event, the user will get matches of other users as their companion as per his preference, the users can then accept or reject the matches based on their interests, past trip experiences, etc.
